 Key Metrics - Monthly Transaction Volumes
 Key Result - Reaching the goal of 15,000 transactions by the end of the fourth month(quarter).
 
 Key Insights - The monthly transactions have on average 2% growth.
                
                The daily transaction volumes are steady around the mean and within 1.5 times standard deviation.
                
                Majority of the transactions(36%) came from inter bank, salary, and Payment transactions.
                
                Young people in the range 25-30 years old do the most transactions.
                
                From early morning to mid day the transactions are less as comapred to other times in the day.
